# Basic Exercises Index

The following exercises are a good practice for basic **if...else** and **loops** statements.

1. [Guess the number](1_Guess_the_number.py). Here you'll create a mini-game to guess a random number with as many tries as you want. Now, every time you fail, the program must tell you if your guess was high or low and suggest you to add or remove 1 to your guess.

2. [Rock, Paper and Scissors](2_Rock_Paper_Scissors.py). This is an extensive but really good practice exercise for *if..else* statements. You'll create the classic paper, rock and scissors. The tricky parte here will be to make the computer choice, but you can fix it quickly with a module that allows you to select random numbers. After 5 loops if should tell you the winner and counts the wins, losses and ties.

The following exercises are a good practice for basic **lists**. Lists could be hard to understand if you don't practice them so try at leats to do the following short exercises. Now, as good practice, I would suggest you to use functions whenever possible to get used to them since they are a pillar for every programmer.
