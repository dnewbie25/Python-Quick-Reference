# Testing Code

Python offers a module in order to test our code so we can make sure every line does exactly what we want it to do.

## unittest Module

The module **unittest** offers programmers a powerful tool to make debugging to their code in order to solve any issue even before executing the whole program.

This relies on two methods called **Unit Testing** and **Test Cases**.

**Unit Test**: Ensures that one specific aspect of a function is correct.

**Test Case**: ItÂ¿s a collection of unit tests to make sure that the whole function is correct.

A good test case is when you use every all possible inputs a user might enter to your program to see what happens to that function.
