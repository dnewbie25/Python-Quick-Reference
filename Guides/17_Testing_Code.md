# Testing Code

Python offers a module in order to test our code so we can make sure every line does exactly what we want it to do.

## unittest Module

The module **unittest** offers programmers a powerful tool to make debugging to their code in order to solve any issue even before executing the whole program.

This relies on two methods called **Unit Testing** and **Test Cases**.
