# Lists or Arrays

This chapter will be long enough to count as two or three sections. Lists, as wee as dictionaries and tuples are other kinds of data types you'll use almost all the time. Once you finish this section you can start writing a vast number of programs. Variables, strings, numbers, functions, loops, conditionals and lists. These are the foundations of every programming language

Now for short, a list is a way to store multiple elements in one single variable and being able to access them by using indexes. Think of it as a bookshelf, with every book labeled as the first, second or third one in the bookshelf. **It's a collection of items in a particular oder**.

You can put anything you want in the order you want

~~~python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'] # Each element must be separated by a comma
print(bicycles) # Prints ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
~~~

You can access elements in a list by using its index[]. Remember that a computer starts counting in zero.

~~~python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[0]) # Prints 'trek'
print(bicycles[3].upper()) # Prints 'SPECIALIZED'
~~~
