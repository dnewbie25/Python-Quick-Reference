# Python-Quick-Reference
This repository contains the basic yet handul information about Python for beginners. It was primary used as my own reference when learning Python and programming.

The *Table of Contents* lists all the references for the exercises. They won't explain you how the language works inside your computer but how you can use all of its instructions to create short but useful programs. I really love learning by doing, so I suggest you to go to [Python's official](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download it. Programming is path of never stop learning. So I suggest you to find an IDE ( Search what an IDE is) that you find easy to use. There are hundreds of possible ways to program, fell free to play around with a couple of them (VS Code or Sublime Text are my recommendations).

Once you have downloaded your IDE start typing the code you'll find in the guides, press 'Run' or 'Debug and Run' and that's it.

Once you have read all of my guides, let's move to the *Example Exercises* folder. You might be afraid of not knowing enough, but programming is like math, you need to practice and challenge yourself in order to progress. You'll never move from beginners to intermediate if you never attempt to solve a task.

## Examples - Basic Exercises

I won't explain much about the code in the examples. The best way to learn what the code does is to type it yourself in you own IDE (do not copy it, type it) and explore what it does, what's its purpose.

1.  [Guess The Number](Example%Exercises/Basic%Exercises/1_Guess_the_number.py): This is a basic guessing game where you can enter a number and see if it matches the one selected by the computer. A good practice for conditionals.
2.  (Rock, Paper and Scissors)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/2_Rock_Paper_Scissors.py]: You can go deeper into programming logic by recreating a simple game. Here you can practice conditionals and loops.
3.  (Guest List)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/3_Guest_List.py]: You'll create a list of the people you want to invite to a party.
4.  (Changing Guest List)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/4_Changing_Guest_List.py): You will modify the previous list, removing a random person and adding a totally different one.
5.  (More Guests)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/5_More_Guests.py]: Here you will append people at the beginning, middle and end of a list with a useful method.
6.  (Shrinking List)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/6_Shrinking_List.py]: You will now remove people fro the list until you get an empty list.
7.  (Seeing The World)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/7_Seeing_The_World.py]: You will sorte and reverse sort a list of places you would like to visit.
8.  (Dinner Guests Length)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/8_Dinner_Guests_Length.py]: You'll create a new list of people and gets the number of people you added to that list.
9.  (List Methods Recap)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/9_Lists_Methods_Recap.py]: Because you need to practice lists a lot, here you get a brief summary of the methods for working with lists.
10. (Pizza and Animals)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/10_Pizza.py]: You'll use a short list for looping through a pizza ingredients and a set of pets.
11. (Lists Looping Methods)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/11_Lists_Methods.py]: Here you'll find a recap of all the basic ways to loop through a list.
12. (Slicing Lists)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/12_Slicing_Lists.py]: How to slice a list and print a certain number of elements from the X to Y indexes? Here you'll find the answer.
13. (Tuples)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/13_Tuples.py]: Because I know you are bored of lists, you can find a new type of list here, one you can't modify like the previous ones.
14. (Dictionaries)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/14_Dictionaries.py]: For short, a different kind of list, where you have a key-value pair. Take a look at it to understand more about it.
15. (Dictionaries with Lists & Loops)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/15_Dictionary_with_List_&_Loops.py]: Now we are getting serious. This is one of the most basics ways to handle data in your program. Put attention to it.
16. (Dictionary Polling)[Example Exercises/Basic Exercises/16_Dictionary_Polling.py]: Back to small projects, you will create a short poll and compare which people have answered it and who hasn't.
