# Python-Quick-Reference
This repository contains the basic yet handul information about Python for beginners. It was primary used as my own reference when learning Python and programming.

The *Table of Contents* lists all the references for the exercises. They won't explain you how the language works inside your computer but how you can use all of its instructions to create short but useful programs. I really love learning by doing, so I suggest you to go to [Python's official](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download it. Programming is path of never stop learning. So I suggest you to find an IDE ( Search what an IDE is) that you find easy to use. There are hundreds of possible ways to program, fell free to play around with a couple of them (VS Code or Sublime Text are my recommendations).

Once you have downloaded your IDE start typing the code you'll find in the guides, press 'Run' or 'Debug and Run' and that's it.

Once you have read all of my guides, let's move to the *Example Exercises* folder. You might be afraid of not knowing enough, but programming is like math, you need to practice and challenge yourself in order to progress. You'll never move from beginners to intermediate if you never attempt to solve a task.
