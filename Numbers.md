# Numbers

**Numbers** will be, along with **Strings** and **Boolean**, the most used data types you'll encounter in you development path. But don't worry, you don't to be a math genius to program, just play around and familiarise yourself with some basic math methods.

Before anything else, remeber there are two basic number type, **Integers** and **Floats** that you can see in the [Variables](Variables.md) section.

## Long numbers with '_'

You can use underscores '_'_ to separate large numbers. Python will think it's a regular number without underscores.

~~~python
number = 14_000_000_000_000_000 # It will be easier for people to read this number
print(number) #Print '14000000000000000' because Python will ignore the underscores

## CONSTANTS

A constant is a number that won't change during the execution of the program. Python doesn't differentiate constant from regular numbers, so a good practice is to use a variable name with all capital letters for constants so you can recognize them easily.

MY_CONSTANT = 14521
